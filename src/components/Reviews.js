                I'm not a big fan of dating apps and was looking for a different
                way to meet people. I met some great people at{" "}

                and even had a few dates. I highly recommend their events to
                anyone looking to expand their social circle and meet new
                people.

                Attended singles party in Marylebone and met some lovely ladies

                So much better than dating apps. Nice to meet people in real
                life and actually see quickly if you like them or not. Didnâ€™t
                meet anyone I liked but want to keep trying it out.
