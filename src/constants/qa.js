    q: 'Why is True Dating a better alternative to dating apps?',
    a: 'Dating apps are tedious, time consuming, photos can be misleading, matching with someone can turn into serial messaging without an end to an actual date - need we go on? True Dating allows you the opportunity to meet lots of other single people, in real-life, that are also looking for that someone special.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between Speed Dating and Singles Parties?',
    a: 'Our Speed Dating events are a series of short dates (typically 4-5 minutes each) where you will meet everyone for one date each. Singles Parties are exactly that - a gathering of singles typically held in a venue where everyone has the space to walk around, have a few drinks and mingle. Both types of events will have our friendly hosts on-hand to keep the event flowing smoothly and ensure you have a great time.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I attend events even if I don’t fit the age range?',
    a: (
      <>

      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'What should I wear to the event? Is there a dress code?',
    a: 'There is no dress code. We encourage everyone to come as the best version of themselves, in something they will feel confident and comfortable in but why not dress to impress?!',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I bring a friend with me?',
    a: 'Of course! We very frequently have groups of friends attend events together - just make sure everyone has bought their individual tickets for entry, online and through our website. We will not accept payment at the door.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How many people will I meet?',
    a: 'This depends on the event - for speed dating, you will typically meet 10-15 people, while our Singles Parties can be a much higher number depending on the turnout for that event.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What kind of people can I expect to meet at the events?',
    a: 'Just like London itself, our daters range from all backgrounds, ages, personalities and walks of life. We find most people who attend our events are confident, respectful and genuine people looking for love.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need to do anything before the event?',
    a: (
      <>
        No, just be sure to show up a little early or right on time to the event so we can get
        started. If you ever have any questions before the event, you can contact us at{' '}

    q: 'What happens after a speed dating event?',
    a: 'After the event, you will need to log in to your True Dating account and let us know who you fancy! The day following the event, you will be able to see who you matched with and message securely via your True Dating account.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How will I know if I matched with someone at speed dating?',
    a: 'You will receive an email the following day after 5pm alerting you that your matches are live.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What if I don’t meet anyone I’m interested in?',
    a: 'Majority of the time, we find our daters typically would like a second date with at least one person they meet, however, if you don’t - your next speed dating event is on us!',

    q: 'How does payment work?',
    a: 'We only accept card payments securely via our website. This is done via Stripe, a leading company in payments and security. We will never repeat bill you for an event. We do not accept cash on the door.',

  {
    q: 'What information can my matches see?',
    a: 'The only personal information your matches can see is your name and your photo, if you choose to upload one on your account. You will be able to securely message them via your account rather than email.',
