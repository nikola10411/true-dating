        <br />
        <p>
          If you decide to book a True Dating event, you are registering your acceptance of our
          terms & conditions and privacy policy (which can find on your website)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By entering into this agreement you are agreeing to abide by all of the terms & conditions
          set out by True Dating as well as their rules and procedures during the events.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you fail to attend an event at the published start time or leave an event early, this
          will result in the forfeiture of your tickets. Each events start time will be clearly
          stated on our website and subsequent confirmation emails will be sent to each attendee.
          Please be on time in consideration to the other attendees and to avoid potentially missing
          the event.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Ticket purchases, including advance ticket credit purchases are non-refundable.</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cancellations or booking change requests must be received at least 72 hours prior to the event start time. Within this window we are able to offer you a credit to attend another available event of the same value as your original booking. We can only accept one change request per booking
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Booking name changes and direct substitutions can be made up to 5 pm on the day of the
            event by contacting us by email:{' '}
            <Link href='mailto:contact@truedating.co.uk'>contact@truedating.co.uk</Link>.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Under extremely exceptional circumstances, venues are subject to change or cancellation
            at any time prior to the event start time on the day of the event.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Our free event guarantee only applies after your first speed dating or singles party event. If you do not claim this free event after this time the offer will be invalid. Discounted tickets and special offers are excluded from this offer.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Should we have to cancel an event for any reason outside of our control tickets will not
            be refunded. Instead, a credit for the same monetary value will be issued. Credits can
            be redeemed against any standard speed dating events on our rolling programme as listed
            on our website. There is a six month time limit for redeeming these credits.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Unfortunately True Dating canâ€™t guarantee you will meet a specific number of attendees
            at a given event or that there will be an equal number of male and female guests
            attending or that attendees will meet specific age criteria. However we will always try
            to make sure the male to female ratio is equal and if there is a lop sided event we will
            offer a free credit for a future event.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            True Dating hosts it's events at venues that are independently owned and run. Therefore
            for any damages suffered, physical or otherwise, you agree that True Dating and its
            associates cannot be held responsible or liable.

          <li>
