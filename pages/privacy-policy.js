        <br />
        <p>
          True Dating is a sole trader. The company was formed in October 2019 and began trading in
          January 2020.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>This policy refers to True Dating solely.</p>
        <br />
        <p> Lawful basis for collecting your data.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We collect some personal data to facilitate the events that we organise. Therefore,
          collecting your data is necessary for us to perform the contract with you. We will treat
          your data in an appropriate and lawful manner, in accordance with UK data protection laws
          and GDPR - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>What data we collect</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you register for a True Dating event we collect the following personal information
          from you; your name, your gender, your phone number and your email address so that we can
          provide you with our services. To attend one of our events it is mandatory to create an
          account and include all of the above information. Without all of these details you will be
          unable to attend any of our events.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It should be noted that we do not store or have access to your payment details. These are
          securely handled via our payment provider PayPal and we do not have the ability to view
          your card details at any point, they are transmitted securely to our processor.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a client we give you the option to add further details to create a profile. This
          profile is shown only to people you have met in person at our events. This optional data
          includes a profile image and a short bio. Both are optional.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We also record which events you have attended, and the preferences you select towards the
          guests you met at our events (IE Yes, Friend or Not my type), the matches you received and
          we store the transcripts of conversations that take place over our messaging system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you give us a friend's information during the booking process, we will use it to
          provide the services you request from us. Before you give us a friend's information (their
          name and email address), please be sure that you have your friend's permission to share
          that information with us.
